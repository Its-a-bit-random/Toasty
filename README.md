# Toasty

A powerful Luau game framework inspired by Flamework for Roblox-TS. Toasty is intended to be the most advanced framework for luau while maintaining a simple API.

## Features

- Networking system with automatic runtime type-checking
- Service/Controller architecture similar to `Knit`
- Automatic dependency load order (optional)
- Lifecycle system with support for creating custom lifecycle events

...and more coming the future!

## Installing

> [!WARNING]
> Although Toasty has been used in production, it has not yet been fully battle-tested. It should be pretty stable as-is however if you find bugs please create an issue!

Currently you can only install from wally

```toml
Toasty = "its-a-bit-random/wally@1.0.0-pre.5"
```
