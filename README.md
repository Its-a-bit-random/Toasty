# Toasty

Powerful Luau game framework.

## Usage

Currently `Toasty` is expected to be used as a Git Submodule as it is not intended to be public. To sync toasty into your project start off by adding it as a submodule:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/its-a-bit-random/toasty.git
```

Then add it to your rojo project whever you like it to go. You can point Rojo to the Toasty directory or to Toasty's `default.project.json` either should work with newer version of Rojo.

## Docs

Docs are currently local only as we dont have access to private GitHub pages. Clone the repo or CD into your submodule version and run

```bash
moonwave dev --code Source
```
